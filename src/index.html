        Head towards the main entrance of the lodge and there’ll be someone there to direct you to the right place.</p>

      <p class="text-center">Thank you for thinking of giving us something to commemorate our big day!</p>
      <p class="text-center">Traditionally, newlyweds will move into their new home together after the wedding and will set up gift registers for
        this. But as many of you know, we did this a while ago and we’re pretty much sorted for everything…</p>

      <p class="text-center">So, if you’d like to give us something - and you don’t have to! - we’d love it if you could donate to our chosen charities.
        You can donate online through our Virgin Money Giving page or use the post box on the day itself.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The dress code is smart, but not overly formal - we’d like suits and dresses, but hats aren’t necessary and colourful
          patterned socks are actively encouraged. </li>
        <li>The wedding ceremony starts at 1pm, so we recommend that you arrive from 12:30pm.</li>
        <li>After the ceremony there will be drinks and canapes while photos are being taken, with the meal beginning at around
          3pm. Because it’s mid-afternoon, we would recommend that you’ve had a hearty breakfast or light early lunch before
          coming to the ceremony.</li>
        <li>After the meal there will be reception drinks, with the DJ and dancing up and running from 7pm. There will be a buffet
          in the evening so you’ve got loads of energy for dancing.</li>
        <li>We get the park to ourselves after dusk, but because of restrictions the party will finish at 11pm.</li>

      <h2 class="text-center">Local area</h2>
      <span class="divider"></span>
      <p>There’s a list of Richmond hotels on Tripadvisor at this link. We’re staying at the Richmond Hill Hotel, but a lot
        of the local hotels (unsurprisingly) are expensive so you may prefer to look further afield.</p>
      <p>The last District line train leaves Richmond at 00:03, so you’ll have plenty of time to get on the Tube at the end
        of the night.</p>

      <p>We’ve been to the Marlborough and Jackson &amp; Rye before and would recommend both for food, if you’re looking for
        that pre-wedding breakfast. Plus, the Ole &amp; Steen bakery on the High Street is one of our favourite places if
        you’re looking to grab a quick coffee pastry, sausage roll or sandwich.</p>

      <p>Just a warning - Richmond Station and Richmond High Street are at the bottom of a large hill, and our venue is at the
        top. It probably doesn’t look like a long walk on Google Maps, but please bear the hill in mind. Unfortunately the
        buses don’t make it all the way up the hill, so an Uber or taxi is probably your best bet for getting up to the venue
        in a relaxed way.</p>
